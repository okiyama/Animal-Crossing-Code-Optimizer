//Always starts on !
//Codes use: #%&@, 2-9, a-z, A-Z
Haven't seen a code with a 1 in it, which seems odd but must just be an oddity of this weird encryption method
Also none with a 0, probably for readability reasons

All keyboards are 10 x 4

Can only move strictly left and right, no diagonal
L and Y maintain cursor position
No wrapping
D-pad moves around the text, should be useless for my purposes


!?"-~(--)';:(key)
qwertyuiop
asdfghjkl(\n)
zxcvbnm,./(space) (R also does a space)

L for caps:
1234567890
QWERTYUIOP
ASDFGHJKL(\n)
ZXCVBNM,.(space)

Y for punct (from either lower or upper case)
#?(unused characters)
%&@ (unused characters)
(a bunch of unused characters)

Y for icons, unused

State transitions:
  Small < -- > Large
  Small   -- > Punct
  Large   -- > Punct
  Punct   -- > Small (costs 2, goes through icons)
