==== This is NOT my code, I am working from a base of code written by Gary Kertopermono who ported their PHP code from a C version originally written by Ryan Holtz (@TheMogMiner) ====

The website is available here: http://retrocheater.multiverseworks.com/acuc2/index.php?mod=generator

What I am doing with the code is extending it to automatically find optimal town and player names
which will minimize the travel distance of all the codes needed for Animal Crossing 100%

I'm going to be using the codes listed in this route:

as well as this addendum:

I'll put those files in this repository for safe keeping as well.

I initially started working with Ryan Holtz's C version, however I talked to Zoekay and they told me that the 1.7 version of the C code (which I was working from) seems to be adding some information to the playername and townname
As such, the codes come out wrong. I verified in game they do not work. They suggested that I work from the PHP code base, since it has a number of improvements and is
considered the definitive version. So, I trashed my work on the C code and now I'm going to start over with the PHP vode.
